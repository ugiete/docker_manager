## About The Project

Docker Manager is a project based on the useful Docker Desktop available for MacOS and Windows. This project was firstly planned to help people using Linux environments to have their first impressions with Docker in a softly way.

Later, this project had two main goals: For me is an opportunity to show my skills building a whole desktop application with the brand new Flutter Desktop framework and using Python to communicate in the server-side, and for the general public to have an entrypoint to start learning Flutter and Docker. With this project, one could edit and publish their own version or maybe use some (or all) functions presented here to manage a couple of containers without more heavy stuff, like Kubernets or Docker Swarm. However this project is intend to personal use only, if you would like to manage your services in a production scenario, please use some of the more robust container management applications available.

### Built With

* [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/multi-platform/desktop)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/about/)

## Getting Started

This project was made with Ubuntu 20.04, so the documentation will describe how to install and run in a Ubuntu/Debian environment, I hope to add more details of how to utilize it in other platforms later.
